      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Walking in Streets of Atlanta </h1>
    <p> This class was about walking and how walking is a fundamental part of the human existence.  If you look throughout history, many of the great thinkers were walkers in some type of way. 
     The list of famous walkers include most the founders of the major religions Prophet Muhammed, Christ, and The Buddha, includes the vanguards Greek philosophy like Plato and Aristotle, and leaders of non-violence like Gandhi, Mandela, and King. 
     Even though all these people were walkers, the type of walks that these individuals went on were different. Here is a recording of a interview with a friend where we talk about the importance of walking.
