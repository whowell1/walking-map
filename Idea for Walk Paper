Idea. 
The idea is the number of miles that we have walked in a semester so that we see how far we have walked from Atl. For example as user, if put 150 miles on a text box, I can see from Atl, where 150 can take me. 

Technologies used
  React
  Google maps 
   Distance Matrix API to calculate distance
  
  
Challenges/Things to figure out 
  How to connect the back and front end
     Are we going to convert steps to miles?????? or have the user enter miles.
